"""
Step 3: Managing Your Data (CRUD on Data Points)

What is CRUD?
-------------
CRUD stands for the four basic operations you can perform on data:
- CREATE: Add new documents
- READ: Search/query documents
- UPDATE: Modify existing documents
- DELETE: Remove documents

What makes ChromaDB special?
-----------------------------
Regular databases search for EXACT words. ChromaDB understands MEANING!

Example:
- Regular search: "flight" only finds documents with the word "flight"
- ChromaDB: "airplane travel" finds documents about flights, even without that exact word!

This is called "Semantic Search" - searching by meaning, not just keywords.

What are Embeddings?
--------------------
Think of embeddings as "coordinates in meaning space":
- Similar concepts are close together
- Different concepts are far apart
- ChromaDB automatically creates these for you!
